Aggreko is a global leader in the supply of temporary power generation, temperature control systems, and energy services, providing backup energy and power supply whenever and wherever their customers need it. Aggreko uses Azure Synapse to increase operational efficiency with the just-in-time supply of their specialist equipment.
Aggreko’s data ingestion pipeline was set up to run every eight hours because it took four hours to run the ingestion (batch) jobs. Moreover, the data warehouse had to be rebuilt every day due to storage limitations. This meant that there was a lag of 8-24 hours between when the data arrived and when it was available for data analytics pipelines:

By adopting Azure Synapse, Aggreko was able to significantly improve its time-to-insight by reducing ingestion complexities and improving speed. Ingestion time was reduced from four hours to less than five minutes. This in turn meant that for Aggreko, data is now available for analytics pipelines in near real-time (less than five minutes’ lag). The team also estimated that they have saved 30-40 percent of their time—this time was spent solving technology problems in their legacy systems. By adopting Azure Synapse, data is now available for instant exploration, which means that the Aggreko team has more time to focus on solving business problems.
"Azure Synapse gives us a single environment to explore and query the data without moving it. So at a spectrum of the volume of data, we can achieve exponentially faster insights, by querying directly over the lake before outputting insight to Power BI." —Elizabeth Hollinger, Director of Data Insights at Aggreko
As mentioned before, this use case is based on a real-world scenario where Aggreko adopted Azure Synapse as their analytics platform. To learn more about this customer story, you can watch this interview with Aggreko’s Director of Data Insights.

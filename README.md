# AZ-305: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions

- **[Link to case studies (HTML format)](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-305-DesigningMicrosoftAzureInfrastructureSolutions/)**
- **Are you a MCT?** - Have a look at our [GitHub User Guide for MCTs](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/MCT-User-Guide/)

## Course update - 28 January 2022

- The Fabrikam Residences case study is now the Module 8 case study. This ensures the end of Day 3 has a case study. This case study reviews and covers all the content up to this point in the course. 
- The Network Option 1 case study was removed. There is now only one Network case study - BI Enterprise Application. 

## What are we doing?

To support this course, we will need to make frequent updates to the course content to keep it current with the Azure services used in the course.  We are publishing the case studies on GitHub to allow for open contributions between the course authors and MCTs to keep the content current with changes in the Azure platform.

## How should I use these files relative to the released MOC files?

- The instructor handbook and PowerPoints are still going to be your primary source for teaching the course content. **There is also a case study handout with suggested instructor solution**. 

- It is recommended that for every delivery, trainers check GitHub for any changes that may have been made to support the latest Azure services, and get the latest files for their delivery.

## What about changes to the student handbook?

- We will review the student handbook on a quarterly basis and update through the normal MOC release channels as needed.

## How do I contribute?

- Any MCT can submit a pull request to the code or content in the GitHub repro, Microsoft and the course author will triage and include content and changes as needed.

- You can submit bugs, changes, improvement and ideas.  Find a new Azure feature before we have?  Submit a new demo!

## Notes

### Classroom Materials

It is strongly recommended that MCTs and Partners access these materials and in turn, provide them separately to students.  Pointing students directly to GitHub to access steps as part of an ongoing class will require them to access yet another UI as part of the course, contributing to a confusing experience for the student. An explanation to the student regarding why they are receiving separate  instructions can highlight the nature of an always-changing cloud-based interface and platform. Microsoft Learning support for accessing files on GitHub and support for navigation of the GitHub site is limited to MCTs teaching this course only.
